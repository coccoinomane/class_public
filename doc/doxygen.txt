# Config file used by doxygen to generate CLASS documentation.
#
# To generate the documentation, run `make doxy` from the CLASS
# folder; if you prefer to do it manually, run `doxygen doc/doxygen.txt`.
# Doxygen will process CLASS source code and create a folder `doc/doxygen`
# containing the documentation.
#
# To see the documentation in a browser, open `doc/doxygen/index.html`
# or use the shortcut `doc/doc.html` (available only if you used make above).
# To see it as a PDF, first compile it with `cd doc/doxygen/latex; make`,
# then open the file `doc/doxygen/latex/refman.pdf`.
#
# By default, doxygen will call latex to typeset formulas. If latex stops
# for an error, just press enter to skip that particular formula and go on.
# To disable latex, either because it's too slow or because you don't have
# it installed, modify the latex settings below.
#
# An explanation of the various configuration keys can be found
# in the file doxygen_template.txt, which is created by running
# `doxygen -g doxygen_template.txt`
#
# Make sure to have doxygen installed on your system. On a Mac
# with a Macports installation, just run `sudo port install doxygen`.
#
# This file was tested with doxygen v1.8.9.1.
